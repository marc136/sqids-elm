# [Sqids Elm](https://sqids.org/elm)

Sqids (pronounced "squids") is a small library that lets you generate YouTube-looking IDs from numbers. It's good for link shortening, fast & URL-safe ID generation and decoding back into numbers for quicker database lookups.

## Development

You need the Elm compiler and an elm test runner (e.g. [elm-test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm-test) or [elm-test-rs](https://github.com/mpizenberg/elm-test-rs)).

An easy way to get started is with node.js and [elm-tooling](https://elm-tooling.github.io/elm-tooling-cli/).

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install
npx elm-tooling install
# Run tests in watch mode
npx elm-test-rs --watch
```

### CI

@todo add the [elm-tooling-action GitHub action](https://github.com/mpizenberg/elm-tooling-action).
